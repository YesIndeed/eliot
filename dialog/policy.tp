I'm all for recycling--think of the fish!

Every week, members of our church go around town and pick up the recycling.

compost|environment
Composting can help us help our environment--and it's great for getting rid of bodies! Ha ha ha. Joking, of course.

dead bodies
It was just a joke. You really shouldn't be reading too deeply into all of this.

nature|environment
I think that we have to keep our beautiful nature preserve untouched, but we still need to build an overpass.

I just donâ€™t think unions are a good idea. They slow our workers down. The church does enough!

A productive worker is a happy worker -- and a union-less worker.

I'm also committed to increasing the productivity of our town.
I believe that we need to commit ourselves to improving our education system.
I think that unions are strictly unnecessary for the productivity of our people.
My friend in the Church are quite enthusiastic about the new overpass.
