My name is Eliot, and I'm running for Mayor -- I hope you'll be inspired to vote for me!
I'm just like you! Let's get along.
I do hope I'll carry your vote.
Having an inclusive community is dreadfully important.
Did that sound a bit culty? Ha ha ha.
Well, you can't have folks leaving on you!

We need to stick to our common ground; wouldn't it be swell if we could all get along?
I hope to *ease* some of the tensions that have developed in this fine town of ours.
Ha ha ha! Well I'm not sure about that.
Yes, yes... I do think so.
---
That's a bit much! Let's cool it down a bit.
I do hope you didn't mean that.
I'm not sure that's right...
---
Maybe that would be better kept to yourself.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable continuing.
I get the feeling that you think some things which aren't true.
Alright, now back off.
