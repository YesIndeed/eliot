Hello there! I just wanted to stop by, introduce myself, and welcome you to our town of Cranbury. Iâ€™m Eliot Duncann, the Mayor here. You can always swing by my office if you have any questions. Or better yet, you can ask them here. Ha ha.

I'm just like you! Let's get along.
I do hope I'll carry your vote.
Having an inclusive community is dreadfully important.
We need to stick to our common ground; wouldn't it be swell if we could all get along?
What else can I do for you?
